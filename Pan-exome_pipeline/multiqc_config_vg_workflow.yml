report_comment: >
  This report was generated using the <a href="https://github.com/vgteam/vg_wdl" target="_blank">vg_wdl</a> analysis pipeline, 
  which draws upon the research conducted by Liao, WW., Asri, M., Ebler, J. et al. A draft human pangenome reference. Nature 617, 312â€“324 (2023). 
  <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-05896-x" target="_blank">doi:10.1038/s41586-023-05896-x</a>. Substantial modifications have been made to the pipeline, 
  including the integration of tools for variant calling, annotation, and reporting. These enhancements aim to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the pipeline to better meet our specific research requirements.
